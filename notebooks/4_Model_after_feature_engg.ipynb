    "### 5 Tuning the Models\n",
    "When a model is created using the `create_model()` function it uses the default hyperparameters. In order to tune hyperparameters, the `tune_model()` function is used. This function automatically tunes the hyperparameters of a model on a pre-defined search space and scores it using stratified cross validation. The output prints a score grid that shows Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1 and Kappa by fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: `tune_model()` does not take a trained model object as an input. It instead requires a model name to be passed as an abbreviated string similar to how it is passed in `create_model()`. All other functions in pycaret.classification require a trained model object as an argument."
