    "The `setup()` function initializes the environment in pycaret and creates the transformation pipeline to prepare the data for modeling and deployment. `setup()`must be called before executing any other function in pycaret. \n",

    "* All other parameters are optional and are used to customize the pre-processing pipeline (we will see them in later tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "When `setup()` is executed, PyCaret's inference algorithm will automatically infer the data types for all features based on certain properties. The data type should be inferred correctly but this is not always the case. To account for this, PyCaret displays a table containing the features and their inferred data types after setup() is executed. If all of the data types are correctly identified enter can be pressed to continue or quit can be typed to end the expriment. Ensuring that the data types are correct is of fundamental importance in PyCaret as it automatically performs a few pre-processing tasks which are imperative to any machine learning experiment. These tasks are performed differently for each data type which means it is very important for them to be correctly configured."
